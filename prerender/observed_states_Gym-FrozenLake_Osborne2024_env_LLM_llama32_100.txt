{"4": "You are currently located on the ice, with an ice hole situated to your east. To move around, you have the following options: down (0), right (1), left (2), or forward (3). Your previous actions and their outcomes were as follows: falling through a hole in the ice (action 3) led to you being on the ice with an ice hole south of your current position, which was reached after initially falling through a hole in the ice. Prior to that, you were at the start position, then fell through another hole in the ice, and finally ended up on the ice with this specific ice hole east of your location.", "0": "You are currently at the starting position of the grid-based environment. This means you have not moved from your initial location yet and have four possible directions to choose from: up (direction 0), right (direction 1), forward (direction 2), or down (direction 3). Each of these actions will determine your next step in the environment, with each direction having a corresponding outcome.", "1": "You currently find yourself on ice, with an ice hole situated to your south. The only way to move from this location is by taking one of four possible actions: moving up (direction 0), down (direction 1), left (direction 2), or right (direction 3). To better understand your surroundings, note that the ice hole directly to your south presents an available destination. Your previous action in this episode was to move left (action 0), resulting in reaching this current state.", "5": "In this current state, you have fallen through a hole in the ice and are now at original environment state 5. The environment has revealed that there's a gap beneath you, and you've been dropped down to this position. You can see four possible directions to move from here: up (0), right (1), down (2), or left (3). Previously, you were on ice, just south of the hole (state 1), then at the starting point (state 0), and just north of the start, looking south towards the hole (state 2) before falling through.", "8": "You are currently standing on the same patch of ice where you previously fell through a hole in the ice, resulting in an original environment state of 5. To your south is still an ice hole that you can potentially fall into again. You have four possible actions to take from this position: moving north (index 0), east (index 1), west (index 2), or down through the hole (index 3).", "9": "You are currently standing on a patch of ice in a grid-based environment. To your north lies an ice hole that appears to be the exit point from this frozen terrain. The available actions you can take from this position are moving up (0), down (1), left (2), or right (3). Your previous experiences suggest that taking action 1 would move you south, which seems to lead back towards the starting point, while action 2 was taken in a similar context but led to falling through an ice hole. This new state is different from its past occurrence where falling through the ice resulted in a negative outcome.", "13": "You are currently standing on the ice in a grid-based environment. To your west, there's an ice hole, which is partially accessible since you've fallen through it before (as indicated by the warning from your previous state). Your immediate surroundings indicate that to your east and west are both ice holes, suggesting a potentially hazardous or blocked path forward. The only clear direction ahead of you is south, where another ice hole awaits. You have four options: move north, which would be out of bounds; move down (south), towards the next ice hole; move left (west) towards the already accessible ice hole; and move right (east) into the other blocked path.", "14": "You are currently standing on a frozen surface with ice holes in all directions, except for the one you're facing, which seems relatively stable. To your north, there's a solid patch of ice, but moving towards it may be tricky due to its unyielding nature. The previous state showed that attempting to move in any direction can result in either falling through a hole or finding another icy surface. Your options for movement are restricted to stepping east or west, which could potentially help you find a more solid surface.", "10": "You are currently on ice, with an ice hole directly to your east. To move forward, you have the following options: you can take a step east (index 0), which would place you near the edge of the hole; or you can try to exit the hole by taking a step south (index 2). Note that attempting to exit the hole may result in further consequences. Your previous states and actions are as follows: you started at the beginning, moved three steps east twice without incident, then stepped eight spaces east before falling through a hole; after that, you moved one space west and landed six spaces east from your start position.", "15": "You found the chest! The current state indicates that you have successfully discovered a treasure chest in the grid-based environment. Your original state was 15, but this is no longer relevant as you've reached a significant milestone. You're currently on the eastern part of the map, with an ice hole to your east and no obstacles or dangers visible. The legal moves available to you are: moving north (0), moving south (1), moving west (2), and moving east (3). To better understand the context of this episode, consider that you previously navigated through a series of events, including falling through a hole in the ice and being on the ice itself.", "12": "The current state indicates that the agent has fallen through a hole in the ice, resulting in a new state of environment 12. The situation is precarious, and the agent must navigate carefully. To its south lies another hole in the ice, while to the east and north are solid areas without holes. The agent can move up (0), left (1), down (2), or stay in place (3).", "6": "You are currently standing on the icy surface in a grid-based environment, with ice holes located to your west and east. To the south, you see another ice hole. The ground beneath you appears solid for now. You can move up (north), down (south), left (west), or right (east) through the available actions. Note that moving into an adjacent ice hole is also a valid option. Keep in mind that the previous episode's outcome was to fall through a hole, which may have affected your current position.", "7": "You have fallen through a hole in the ice while trying to navigate through it. The current state of the environment is state 7. To your east lies another ice hole, to your south is also an open space, and to your north is more ice with a hole nearby. There are several paths you can take to try and exit this situation: move left (action 0), move forward (action 1), go right (action 2), or move up (action 3).", "2": "You are currently standing on the ice and have a view of an ice hole to both your south and east. To move around, you can choose from the following actions: 0 (move forward), 1 (move backward), 2 (try to climb out of the hole) or 3 (try to jump over to the other side). You previously took actions that led to falling through a hole in the ice and trying to climb out, but the previous state before you fell was when you were on the ice with an ice hole to your east, where you tried to move forward.", "11": "You have fallen through a hole in the ice! Your current position is at environment state 11. To move forward, you can try going north (action 0), staying put (no action), or moving south (actions 1 and 3). Alternatively, if you're feeling adventurous, you could go west (action 2) or east (action 4). Be cautious, as to your south is another ice hole.", "3": "You find yourself standing on the icy surface of a frozen lake, with a visible ice hole to the south. To the east, there is another ice hole. The environment has not changed since the last action, and you are still on this frozen surface with no obstacles in sight. Your current position allows you to move north or south towards one of these ice holes, while moving east would take you away from your immediate surroundings."}
