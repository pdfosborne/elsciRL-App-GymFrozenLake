# HELIOS-RL-TEMPLATE

Template of the HELIOS-RL system for applying to new problems.

To apply the template to a new problem:

1. Install HELIOS-RL (private until further development)
2. Clone this repository to local directory
3. Update the environment>engine.py script to setup the problem specific interaction
4. Align adapter to problem (including encoder choice) 
5. Update configuration files as needed

If setup correctly then the rest is handled by the HELIOS system
> Run main.py (change experiment call and parameters as needed)
